# Workflow
This repository is a collection of workflow scripts which (hopefully) boost StackRox engineers' productivity. It has scripts for common tasks that need to be executed frequently, and aims to make them simple.

## How To Use
All the scripts are symlinked to in the `bin/` folder. Clone the repo, and add the `bin/` folder to your path. That way, you'll be able to run all the commands by name.
